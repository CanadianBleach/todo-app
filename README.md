# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would really like to add an account feature, so that multiple people can use the site.
* I think adding a remind feature would be cool. Set a time and get a notification at that time.
* I would like to add a confirm modal, that way you don't accidentally delete your todos.
